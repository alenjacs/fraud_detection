## How to Run

### Option 1: Run in Google Colab 
1. Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of this README.
2. The notebook will:
   - Automatically install required packages
   - Automatically download the dataset from Google Drive
3. Run all cells in the notebook.

### Option 2: Run Locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alenjacs/fraud_detection
   ```

2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. The dataset will be automatically downloaded by the notebook. No manual download needed.

4. Run the notebook:
   Open `fraud_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Size: ~284,000 transactions
- Fraud Rate: ~0.17%

**Note**: The dataset (`creditcard.csv`) is not included in this repo because it exceeds GitHub’s 100 MB limit. Download it from Kaggle and place it in your project folder manually.

## Model Summary
- Model: Random Forest Classifier
- Balancing: SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Training: 80% of the data with SMOTE applied
- Testing: 20% held out for evaluation

---

## Results
- Accuracy: ~99.9%
- Precision (fraud): 86%
- Recall (fraud): 85%
- F1-score (fraud): 86%

Focus was on recall to ensure most fraud cases are detected.
